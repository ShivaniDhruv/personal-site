                        <br>
                    </h2>
                    <p>Our task was to create a Simulink model that models a simple vehicle (bicycle model to be more specific) and implements an automatic cruise control (ACC) system. The haptic wheel in the lab served as the steering wheel of our simulated vehicle and the potentiometer was used to manually control the speed of the vehicle. The position of the wheel was used to determine the angle of the front wheel of the virtual vehicle as well as the steering forces that were needed to reflect back to the wheels. In addition to implementing the vehicle model and the ACC system, we also needed to implement an automatic steering controller using PID controller implementation. The controller was needed to steer the car down the full length of a virtual road by actuating the haptic wheel. Our “vehicle” was also responsive to other “vehicles” or lab stations through CAN communication.</p>

                    <p>At American Showa, I interned as a test engineer. Much of my time was spent at the track helping record and post process data. One particular project I enjoyed was to create a GPS device which was able to integrate with the data acquisition system used for all other testing. I utilized Arduino, Eagle and CANalyzer to design and program the GPS. The final design was small, lightweight and able to communicate with the data acquisition system through Controller Area Network.</p>

                    <p>This year, I have to privilege of being Testing Director for the Michigan Baja Racing Team. Primarily using the Somat Edaq Lite, our team collects data using various sensors including linear potentiometers, strain gauges, mass air flow monitors, accelerometers and more. With this data, the team is able to better understand loading on specific components of the vehicle and therefore reduce weight and improve structure with confidence. The sensors are also used for precise tuning for both the suspension and continuously variable transmission.</p>

                    <h2>Solar Powered Rechargeable Lantern
                        <br>
                    </h2>
                    <p>The town of Samox San Lucas, Guatemala is an off-grid community currently struggling to find an affordable and safe source of lighting. The lack of electricity has led the citizens to use candles and kerosene lamps in order to have light during the night. These options are not only hazardous, but also expensive as the citizens must constantly replace them. These citizens currently living without a consistent source of lighting are our primary target customer. My team and I created a rechargeable solar-powered lantern as a solution to this lighting crisis. The lantern is made out of completely recyclable materials. Key features include an adjustable shoulder strap so our customer can use it as both a shoulder strap which allows for hands free usage and both a high and low light settings. During testing, the lamp was proven last up to 24 hours on low setting and 4.5 hours on high setting. The lamp can charge as fast as an hour and a half though this can obviously differ greatly depending on sunlight available.</p>

                    <h2> Measuring Application for Kinect
                        <br>
                    </h2>
                    <p>As a software developing intern at Microsoft, I was given the responsibilty to debug and implement a new set of application program interfaces or APIs. My final implementation was an application that allowed users to measure photos taken with the kinect by clicking two points and getting the distance between them. The points are shown in the picture above in orange. Other key features include saving and opening a custom file format that includes both RGB and depth information. To put this into perspective, someone would be able to take a photo of an empty room with the kinect and then save the photo. The photo can then be pulled up on a windows phone and the room could be measured at the furniture store on the phone. This application is soon to be published by microsoft as a windows sample application for third party developers. IN addition to creating this sample application, I produced several smaller applications for developers to easily reproduce corner cases of the code which resulted in catching and resolving several bugs in the API.</p>

                    <h2>Three Stage Amplifier Circuit
                        <br>
                    </h2>
                    <p>We created a three stage amplifier circuit comprised of two common emitter circuits in series with a common collector. Each of these circuits used an npn bipolar junction transistor (BJT). The first common emitter was utilized to satisfy the input resistance value and f_L. All the values for the second emitter were almost the same so that f_L would be the same as the first emitter. The only difference is that there was an additional capacitor added to decrease the value of f_H. Both the first and second emitters were used to create a very high gain because we had to counteract the low gain of the common collector along with the loss of gain that comes with the input and output resistance ratios. The purpose of the common collector circuit attached to the end was to reduce the size of the output resistance. </p>
