                    <h2>Baja Racing Electronically Controlled Variable Transmission
                        <br>
                    </h2>
                    <p>Each year, the society of automotive engineers (SAE), holds a series of collegiate competitions called mini Baja. The competition rules level the playing field by
					requiring the same Briggs and Stratton engine to power all vehicles in the race. Therefore, innovation and optimization in the driveline result in the each cars speed and acceleration. 
					The latest project on the Michigan Baja Racing driveline is the development of an electronically controlled variable transmission (EVT). A combustion engine has a maximized 
					torque at a certain rotational speed (RPM) of the crankshaft. In order to maximize the torque at all times, the EVT modifies the ratio between the gearbox and the engine by 
					modifying the distance between the clutches attached to the engine crankshaft. For the EVT, a Hall Effect sensor senses the rotational speed of the shaft and a hybrid stepper
					motor linear actuator adjusts clutch distance. A single input single output closed loop system with a classical controller was used in the final prototype. </p>

					<h2>Ball on Point
                        <br>
                    </h2>
                    <p>The main goal of our project is to design a system that can automatically balance a ball on a plate. Our final demo not only achieved our base goal of 
					balancing a ball on a plate but we were able to succeed in many of our stretch goals as well. Those goals included tracking a variety of shapes and also 
					allowing the user to “draw” their own shapes. We did the latter using a joystick input. In order to accomplish our project we were tasked with selecting 
					components and developing software to successfully balance the ball on a plate. For our sensor, we used a Raspberry Pi computer. With a Pi camera, we were 
					able to extract ball coordinates with a variety of signal processing algorithms. An Arduino was used as the controller and sent pwm signals to two servos 
					which acted as our actuators.</p>

					<h2>Adaptive Cruise Control - Graduate Student Instructor
                        <br>
                    </h2>
                    <p>This will be my third semester leading weekly lab sections for Embedded Control Systems. Embedded Control Systems is a senior/first year graduate level 
					course that teaches students from diverse backgrounds how to implement controls via c code and Simulink autocode generation. We use technology relevant to
					the local automotive industry, including the Freescale MPC 5553 microcontroller and a CAN network. We also use Mathworks tools, Matlab, Simulink, Stateflow, 
					and Real Time Workshop for modeling, analysis, and (in the last stage of the course) autocode generation.</p>

					<h2>Magnetic Levitation
                        <br>
                    </h2>
                    <p>Our system comprised of an infrared light and a phototransistor to sense the height of the ball. The actuator of the system was an electromagnet. A voltage
					to current circuit was designed for the system using an OPA547T operational amplifier as well. A lead controller was chosen to stabilize the system in order
					to reduce the effects of high frequency noise. No integral was term was used as steady state error was not a priority of ours to mitigate. The controller was
					implemented in LabVIEW with a national instruments daq.</p>

					<h2>Inverted Pendulum
                        <br>
                    </h2>
                    <p>Instead of using a classical controller for this system, full state feedback was implemented. The team tracked rotational position and speed of both the 
					horizontal arm and the pendulum of the system. Using the linear quadratic regulator function in matlab, we were able to determine the controller gain applied to 
					each state in the feedback loop. In addition to the balancing controller, we also created a swing up controller. This controller used the angle and speed of the 
					pendulum arm to determine how fast and in what direction to turn the horizontal arm to continuously increase the height of the pendulum swing.</p>
